# To Do Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Deployment by Vercel

In this To Do Application Project, you can:

### `create todo`

Create your new To Do and fill the input.

### `view detail todo`

When you click View on your To Do Table, you can view what should you do in your To Do's description

### `set todo to done`

After you done the activity, you can set your To Do in the table with status `done`

### `edit todo`

You can edit your To Do, even after you set your To Do status as `done`. But if you edit your done To Do, your To Do status will become `not done`
